The error in the given program segment is that the variable 'count' is declared but not being used. If the variable 'count' is not required for any specific purpose, it can be removed.

Here is the corrected program segment:

```c
char s[] = "this is a character array";
for (; *s != '\0'; s++) {
    printf("%c ", *s);
}
```

Explanation:
- The program segment initializes a character array 's' with the given string.
- The for loop iterates through the characters of the array until it reaches the null terminator '\0'.
- Inside the loop, the printf statement prints each character of the array.
- The *s denotes the value at the memory address 's', which is the character being currently pointed to by the loop iteration.
- The corrected code removes the unused 'count' variable, making it more efficient.
