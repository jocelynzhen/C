There are a few errors in the given program segment:

1. Declaration of xPtr: The variable xPtr is declared as a float, which is incorrect as it should be declared as a float pointer to store the address of another float variable. The correct declaration should be:
```c
float x = 19.34;
float* xPtr = &x;
```

2. Incorrect use of printf format specifier: The printf function is used to print the value stored in xPtr, which is the memory address of the float variable x. However, the format specifier `%f` is used, which is incorrect for printing memory addresses. To print a memory address, the format specifier `%p` should be used. The corrected printf statement should be:
```c
printf("%p\n", (void*)xPtr);
```

By making these corrections, the program segment will correctly declare a float pointer variable `xPtr` and print the memory address of the float variable `x`.
