The error in the given program segment is that it is trying to assign a pointer of type float (`realPtr`) to a pointer of type long (`integerPtr`). This is not allowed because pointers of different types cannot be assigned directly to each other.

To correct the error, you can use a typecast to convert `realPtr` to a compatible pointer type before assigning it to `integerPtr`. However, please note that typecasting a pointer should only be done if you are certain that the conversion is valid and will not lead to any issues.

Here's the corrected version of the program segment:

```cpp
float *realPtr;
long *integerPtr;
integerPtr = (long *) realPtr;
```

With the typecast `(long *)`, we explicitly inform the compiler that we are converting `realPtr` to a `long` pointer type. However, please note that if the actual values pointed to by `realPtr` are floating-point numbers, the resulting behavior might not be as expected. So, ensure that you are using typecasting correctly and in a way that aligns with your program's requirements.
