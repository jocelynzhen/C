#include <stdio.h>(a)  float number1 = 7.3, number2; 

This statement declares a floating-point variable named "number1" and initializes it to 7.3. An additional floating-point variable named "number2" is also declared.

(b)  float* fPtr;

This statement declares a pointer variable named "fPtr" which has a type of float. 

(c)  fPtr = &number1;

This statement assigns the address of the variable "number1" to the pointer variable "fPtr". Now, "fPtr" points to the memory location where "number1" is stored.

(d)  printf("%.2f", *fPtr);

This statement prints the value of the object pointed to by "fPtr". The "*" operator is used to access the value stored at the memory location pointed by the pointer. "%.2f" is the format specifier for printing a float value with 2 decimal places.

(e)  number2 = *fPtr;

This statement assigns the value of the object pointed to by "fPtr" to the variable "number2". Again, the "*" operator is used to access the value stored at the memory location pointed by the pointer.

(f)  printf("%.2f", number2);

This statement prints the value of "number2". The "%.2f" format specifier is used to print the float value with 2 decimal places.

(g)  printf("%p", &number1);

This statement prints the address of the variable "number1". The "%p" format specifier is used for printing a pointer/address in hexadecimal format.

(h)  printf("%p", fPtr);

This statement prints the address stored in the pointer variable "fPtr". The "%p" format specifier is used for printing a pointer/address in hexadecimal format. The value printed should be the same as the address of "number1" because earlier "fPtr" was assigned the address of "number1".

(i)  const float* cPtr = &number2;

This statement declares a constant pointer named "cPtr" which can point to a constant object of type float. The pointer is initialized with the address of the variable "number2". Since "cPtr" is a constant pointer, its value (i.e., the address it points to) cannot be changed. However, the value of the object it points to can still be modified.
int main()

    float number1 = 7.3, number2;
