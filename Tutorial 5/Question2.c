(a) In this C program, 'x' is a static array of integers with a size of 8. It is initialized with the values {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80}.

(b) The meaning of (x + 2) is the memory address of the third element in the array 'x'. When we add 2 to 'x', it moves the pointer two positions forward in memory relative to the base address of the array.

(c) The value of *x is the value of the first element in the array 'x'. It is equivalent to x[0], which is 10.

(d) The value of (*x + 2) is the value obtained by adding 2 to the first element in the array 'x'. So, it is equivalent to 10 + 2, which is 12.

(e) The value of *(x + 2) is the value of the third element in the array 'x'. It is equivalent to x[2], which is 30. This is achieved by adding 2 to the base address of the array 'x' and then dereferencing the resulting memory location.
