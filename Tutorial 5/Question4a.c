In the given program segment, there is an error in the declaration and assignment of variables. 

The error is in the line `int *x, y;`. Here, the variable `x` is declared as a pointer to an integer, but the variable `y` is declared as a regular integer. 

To correct this error, we need to explicitly declare `y` as a pointer to an integer as well. 

The corrected version of the program segment would look like this:

```c
int *x, *y;
x = y;
```

Now both `x` and `y` are declared as pointers to integers, and the assignment `x = y;` is valid.
